# ANSO-220: Land / Media / Anthropocene



# **Syllabus** 

<u>Asynchronous Online Class / Spring Quarter 2020</u>
Professor: Dimitris C. Papadopoulos



## **COURSE DESCRIPTION**

Our era of human caused climate crisis and in some cases irreversibly human-altered landscapes and environments that has been identified by scientists as "the Anthropocene" is defined by extinction, environmental disasters, displacement, crises and conflicts on a planetary scale. At the same time, from Climate Strike to Standing Rock, and from Australia to Brazil, new collective voices, new forms of environmental activism, indigenous resistance, anti-capitalist and anti-globalization movements gain momentum, challenge the capitalist logic of extraction, but also seek, and often demonstrate, alternative, decolonial and radical modes of land use, environmental knowledge and perception beyond established hierarchies and dichotomies. In this course we will examine cases of environmental crisis, disaster or injustice and forms of mobilization in response, through a global and comparative perspective and by focusing on some key issues such as land use, extraction, waste, forced migration/displacement, conflict and violence, urbanization, media representation and discourse. The course is structured around the media/environment duality in terms of exploring both mediated/representational as well as embodied/experiential ways of perceiving environmental crises and articulating a "sense of place". It also uses it as a conceptual device to think about alternative, experimental, multimodal, and radical ways of re-imagining and re-mediating places, landscapes, environments in their human and "more than human" networks, relations, and ecologies and drawing from projects, movements and initiatives of environmental activism, indigenous knowledge and resistance, land use and re-claim or digital media, and radical cartography.Students will be able to critically review and explore forms, media and scales of place and the environment, from ethnography and ecocriticism to digital storytelling and mapping, both in collaborative assignments and in a final individual project.

## **COURSE REQUIREMENTS, ASSIGNMENTS, AND GRADING**

### **Asynchronous learning and CR/NC grading.**

This is an online, asynchronous class. You are not required or expected to be “present” at specific times or on specific days. There will be no video lectures. Video conferencing will be optional and available for virtual office hours (see Communication & Collaboration). All classes during Spring Quarter will be applying a CR/NC grading system and all faculty will submit CR/NC final grades to the Registrar at the end of term. Even though the final grades submitted will be strictly CR/NR, I will be using letter-based grades for most class assignments to help students get a better sense of their progress and feel motivated to work at their own pace.**In this class, D is the passing grade. You will need a D (62.5 out of 100) as your final grade to pass the class.** You can reach the CR threshold by any combination of completed assignments you choose based on the following grade weights and allocation.

**Grading will be based on a 100-point scale and allocated as follows:**

- Weekly Blog Posts (400-500 words): 20%
- Reflections / Reviews (4-5 pages): 30%
- Group Readings / Annotations: 10% 
- “Unlexicon”: Collaborative Editing of Keyword Entries: 10%
- Final Paper / Project (7-8) pages 30%

### **Grading Rubric:**

A (92.5-100) A- (89.5-92.4) B+ (86.5-89.4) B (82.5-86.4) B- (79.5-82.4) C+ (76.5-79.4) C (72.5-76.4) C- (69.5-72.4) D+ (66.5-69.4) **D (62.5-66.4)** D- (59.5-62.4)



### **Student Support and Resources** 

Make sure you check your K email regularly, daily if possible, depending on your internet connection, for Moodle course-related announcements, and official K College announcements, updates, and emails. Please contact me in case you expect to have difficulties with access to high speed internet or other communication issues. There is a list of regularly updated guidelines and resources provided by K College.

- Mental Health Resources during COVID-19 offered by K’s Counseling Center: https://counseling.kzoo.edu/covid-19 

<u>Note on Sensitive Content</u>
Although our course does not engage, directly, explicitly or extensively, with aspects of violence or trauma, some of the course materials we will be using (e.g. readings, films and documentaries) address sensitive and difficult issues (e.g. war and conflict, environmental disasters, displacement, disease) and could be emotionally challenging or cause discomfort. I will be always available to discuss any concerns you may have in relation to course material. Additionally, those students with histories of trauma around particular issues should consult with the Counseling Center and the Dean of Students Office to ensure that you are receiving direct support and to work with them to find appropriate accommodations that can be communicated to your professors. 





### **Assignments**

#### **Blog posts:** 

We will be using the class blog on Moodle for weekly discussions. You are expected to post a short (400-500 words) response on a weekly basis following our syllabus schedule. Your posts will be in response to a prompt related to a class reading or material according to the topics defined in the class schedule. The blog posts should include references and short quotations from class readings and materials. You are expected to critically reflect on class readings, discussions and materials and make connections to key concepts, other readings, and resources. Posts will be evaluated on a “posted/not-posted” basis. The grade will be calculated based on overall activity. For example, if you have a post for every single prompt/question, your score will be 100. All weekly blog posts should be submitted on Moodle on the due date by 11 pm. Late posts will not be penalized (see “Dates and Deadlines” section) but I strongly encourage students to maintain a weekly posting schedule to the extent possible. This will help us maintain a good pace of discussion and engagement with all materials throughout the quarter.



#### **Reflections / Reviews:** 

Reflection or review papers are meant to provide a critical reflection on course readings and materials in response to specific prompts. Reflections / reviews will be available on Moodle as online assignments. Reflection / Review papers should be 4-5 pages (double space, Times New Roman, Arial or Calibri 12) long. Submissions will be evaluated based on 1) the extent of directly addressing the prompt 2) the clarity of writing and argument 3) the best use and integration of relevant concepts, course readings and materials. Reflection / review papers should be submitted on Moodle on the due date by 11 pm. 



#### **Group Readings / Annotations:**

We will be reading and annotating together selected texts online. Group Readings / Annotations will be available as online assignments on Moodle. Although certain dates and sessions have been specified for Group Readings / Annotations this is not a real-time collaborative project. You will be evaluated on the basis of participation and contribution to a minimum of two annotated texts by the end of the quarter. 

#### “Unlexicon”: Collaborative Editing of Keyword Entries:

We will be collaboratively editing, commenting on and adding suggested keywords on an online document. We will use “Anthropocene Unseen: a Lexicon” as a starting point but we are not going to be limited to this book. “Unlexicon” sessions will be available as online assignments on Moodle. Although certain dates and “Unlexicon” sessions have been specified this is not a real-time collaborative project. You will be evaluated on the basis of a minimum of two contributions in the form of either critical commentary on existing keywords or new, suggested entries. New entries or commentary should be 2-3 paragraphs long (300-400 words).


#### **Final Paper / Project:**

There will be a final in the form of a take-home exam. For your final paper or project, you are expected to engage deeper and in a critical way with certain concepts, aspects or issues we will be covering in class. You will need to submit an extensive essay (7-8 pages / 2000 - 2500 words, double spaced, Times New Roman, Arial or Calibri 12) that will include references and quotations from class readings and materials as well as from external sources. You will need to use a minimum of 4 cited sources. The final paper or project will be submitted in one of the following formats: 1) essay in docx or pdf file format 2) video, sound or mixed digital storytelling media with required narrative or commentary of at least 2000 words. Due date is June 10, 11:00 pm.

### Basic guidelines for writing assignments

All information and detailed guidelines as well as the prompts for writing assignments will be provided through the course’s Moodle page. All papers should be submitted in .docx or .pdf format. In case of mixed media papers/projects (this only applies to the final paper/project)contact me to make sure we find the best possible way to submit your work.All papers must be in 12-point Times New Roman, Arial or Calibri font, double-spaced with 1-inch margins and pages numbered. All papers need to include proper bibliographic citations; that means that you need to cite your sources not only when you are using a direct quote, but also when you refer to a specific concept, idea or argument, or when you present certain facts, numbers and data. Please use, Chicago Manual of Style, 17th edition: https://www.americananthro.org/StayInformed/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2044 
Make sure that the last page of your papers is a References Cited or Bibliography page following Chicago Manual of Style. Make sure you carefully review and proofread your written work in order to avoid any grammar and syntax errors, repetitions or oversights.

### Dates and deadlines:

The final paper / project is due on June 10. **The late work policy for the final project and the reflections/reviews is defined as follows: after a 24-hour forgiveness the penalty will be 2 points (out of 100) for each day of lateness. Late submissions of blog posts and group annotations will not be penalized.** In order, however, to maintain a productive pace and a good discussion mode, I encourage you to post on the class blog, submit your reflections and reviews or participate in annotations and/or collaborative editing on a regular, weekly basis to the extent possible.
